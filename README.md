# kzeditor
The original [axoloti editor](http://github.com/axoloti/axoloti) for Axoloti core hardware is compatible with older intel macs and older MacOS. This modified editor is compatible with [ksoloti](http://github.com/ksoloti/ksoloti) core hardware so I can edit both side-by-side on my MacOS 10.9 intel macs.
